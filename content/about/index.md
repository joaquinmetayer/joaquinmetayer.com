Hello! I'm Joaquin...

A software developer who writes about my interests and my journey towards self-improvement.

Currently, my main focus is on my career as a software developer, gaining more muscle, and my small and private project A99, which is like a hobby to me.

Every weekday in my life:
.. Wake up at around 5 AM.
.. Studying, coding, or completing pending tasks, which includes working on this website blog and the A99 project.
..  Gym at 7 AM.
.. Raw eggs for breakfast.
.. Then, I'm back to work from 9 AM to 6 PM.
.. Social life? Mmm.
.. Go to bed at 8 PM.

Too bored, yes, i know. 

Simple life >> Focus life = GOOD RESULTS
