But let's go with the lessons and how we are progressing...

I added and at the same time removed the DXY as a confluence.
I simplified to only one pair, which will be EURUSD. The downside is that by trading only one pair, I tend to overtrade, but it's a matter of patience to wait for clear setups.
I canceled my subscription to the TradingView premium plan as it is an unnecessary expense, considering that by trading only one pair, I can set alerts on my own indicator.
Things I need to stop doing:

Adding orders to already open orders.
Calculating my lot size by averaging up the leverage.
Entering orders as if they were a stop reverse.
Not taking into account pullbacks to a higher time frame zone that make me see in M1 as if it were a trend change but it's just a pullback to the higher time frame impulse to then continue its direction.
Things I need to keep doing:

Simplicity in pairs and setups.
Not obsessing over orders or staying glued to the chart.
Pre-market analysis marking zones and possible scenarios.
Things I need to start doing:

Take into account the higher time frame when seeing trend changes in a lower time frame.
DO NOT CHANGE YOUR TRADING STRATEGY, TRUST THE PROCESS
